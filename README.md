# The Rasterizer

Here will be the rasterizer code.

Converting C++ to Java is hell. Java doesn't let you do anything. I miss ``` const vec2& ``` T_T 

Note to future self and developers : when loading huge data into a string inside a for loop, please use stringBuilder or stringBuffer. I was copying the same string literally millions of times with megabytes worth of data.
